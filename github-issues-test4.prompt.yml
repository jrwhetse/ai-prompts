      As a project manager, I would like to import GitHub Issues into a GitHub
      project using either GitHub Workflow or GitHub CLI


      The script should ensure the GH CLI is installed. Do not allow duplicate
      issues. As user for the github project name, the name or link to the
      github project board and link all issues to the github project board and
      set status to an existing board status of Todo. Accept as input, a
      paragraph and extract requirements and format these requirements in github
      issues format to include title, description and subtasks.
