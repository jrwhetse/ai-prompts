      I need help build an AI prompt in yaml format. I need to prompt to be
      consistent enough that when copilot re executes the prompt, it remembers
      how it succeeded previously. It needs to iterate over the solution it
      generates and then fixes the prompt where needed when it encounters
      problems.


      The prompt should include instructions for generating a set of GitHub
      issues and SubTasks from a list of topics. Each issue created should be
      added to an existing GitHub Project board with a status of Todo that is
      attached to the Repository. The prompt should require input from the user
      to make this work, such as The name of the project, the name of the board,
      the list of issues. 


      The exercise should be executed from GH CLI stored on a local system or
      from a GitHub workflow. Any required dependencies for making this happen
      should be included in the prompt
